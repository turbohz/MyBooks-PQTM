# PQTM - MyBooks

## The project

This project was developed during the duration of the course. The specification was provided to us.

** This is not what I would consider a quality nor production ready codebase. **

I tried different programming techniques (also languages), to experiment and acquire practice.

## Contributing

No contributions, bug reports or any feedback will be accepted.
This is a personal project, made public to be part of my porfolio. :)
